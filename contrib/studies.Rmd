## Studies



```{r load-experiments}
library(dplyr)
library(RPostgreSQL)
con <- dbConnect(RPostgreSQL::PostgreSQL(),
                   host = 'localhost',
                   user = 'bety',
                   port = 5432)
studies <- tbl(con, 'experiments') %>%collect %>%  transmute(studyDbId = id,studyName = name) %>% 
  mutate(programDbId = ifelse(grepl("Wheat", studyName), 2,1),
         trialDbId = "99")

jsonlite::toJSON(studies)

```


```{sql, connection = con}
create temporary table studies (
select 
  id as studyDbId,
  name as studyName,
  description as studyDescription,
  start_date as startDate,
  end_date as endDate
  design as statisticalDesign.description
  location as [join locations schemas sitegroups_sites join sites join experiments_sites]
 from experiments);
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
